# Replication of Hollyer et al (2022) *AJPS*

We use the replication package from the Harvard Database linked [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/AWSQTW).

We also found data which could be relevant from the paper cited as the same id strategy: the link is from the author's [personal webiste](http://markoklasnja.com./research.html) and can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wykihaa4w6wm6iy/curse_replication.zip?dl=0).
